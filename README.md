# User Management API

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java 8** 
- **Maven**
- **Docker** (for running PostgreSQL in a container)
- **Gmail account** (for email sending)

## Set Up PostgreSQL Database with Docker

1. **Pull the PostgreSQL image** and run the container with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_DB=management_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:latest
    ```

    This will:
    - Create a PostgreSQL container with the name `postgres-db`.
    - Set the database username to `admin`, the password to `admin`, and the database name to `management_db`.
    - Feel free to user other credentials but make sure you update application.yaml to the new credentials
    - Map port `5432` on your local machine to port `5432` inside the container.
    - Feel free to use other ports but make sure you update the ports in application.yaml also

2. Verify the container is running with:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see the PostgreSQL container running.


## Email Sending with Gmail

For email sending to work properly in the application, you need to configure an email account with the domain **@gmail.com**. Follow the steps below to set up your account and enable email sending.

### Step 1: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your Google account

1. Go to your Google account at [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to the **Security** section.
3. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA). This is required to generate an app password.

### Step 2: Generate an App Password

1. After enabling Two-Factor Authentication, go to the **App Passwords** section.
2. Select **Generate App Password** and follow the instructions to generate an app password.
3. Copy the generated password, which will be used to authenticate your application when sending emails.

For more details on how to create an app password, you can watch this tutorial video: [How to Create an App Password for Gmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXyF5Zb5UY).

### Step 3: Configure the `application.yaml`

Now, with the generated app password, you need to navigate to `application.yaml` and edit it to use your Gmail account.

1. In the `application.yaml` file, locate the `spring.mail.username` and `spring.mail.password` fields.
2. In the `spring.mail.username` field, enter your **Gmail email address** (e.g., `youremail@gmail.com`).
3. In the `spring.mail.password` field, enter the **app password** generated by Google.
4. Don't change the other fields

## Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marcofig98/management-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Build the application** using Maven:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

3. **Run the application** with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.
    feel free to change the port "8080" to another in the application.yaml, if you do it you should update the port in swagger url also

## Access Swagger UI

Once the application is running, you can access the **Swagger UI** at: http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html
Here you can explore and interact with the available endpoints of the API.
